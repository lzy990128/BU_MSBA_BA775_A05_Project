## Report Summary
Our report is divided into two sections. In revenue analysis, we found that courses in the IT & Software has the greatest potential to generate more revenue for Udemy. We deduced that customers are willing to pay higher prices for higher quality courses, that SkillsFuture classes are priced higher than the average in each course category, and that some instructors have led more successful courses with more subscribers than others. In ratings analysis, we discovered that some lower-rated courses generate more revenue than higher-rated ones, and we suspect that different population sizes may have impacted average ratings. We also found that average ratings are positively correlated with subscribers and revenue, SkillsFuture courses are rated higher than average, and that there are popular keywords that are used in titles.

Combining the insights we found from these two sections, we made several recommendations for Udemy that focus on the components that will best maximize revenue.

## Project Proposal
Our main focus was to identify the characteristics shared between Udemy's highest revenue-generating courses. In addition, we also identified the highest average rated courses. As our goal is to maximize Udemy's revenue potential, we must pinpoint features shared among popular courses and understand why having those features makes these courses more appealing to customers. Once we pinpoint what these shared characteristics are, we can apply the same strategy to new courses and increase its chances of success (or being popular among customers).

Through insights generated in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process, our goal is to provide recommendations for the launch of Udemy's new courses. Examples of recommendations include suggesting what keywords to include in course titles, supporting materials to use in each course, and the price for different courses.
